integrity is a tool for calculating, storing and verifying checksums for files.
A number of different types of checksum are supported with the result stored in the file's
extended attributes. This allows the file to be moved between directories
or copied to another machine while maintaining the checksum data along with the file.

Supported checksums include md4, md5, sha1, sha256, sha512, sha3_512, blake2b_512,
oshash and phash
