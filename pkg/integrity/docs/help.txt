integrity is a tool for calculating, storing and verifying checksums for files.
A number of different types of checksum are supported with the result stored
in the file's extended attributes. This allows the file to be moved between
directories or copied to another machine while retaining the checksum data
along with the file.

This checksum data can be used to verify the integrity of the file at a later
date and ensure it's contents have not been changed or become corrupted.

The checksum data is also useful for efficiently finding duplicate files in
different directories.
